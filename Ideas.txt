Important factors that make a good League player:
    Ability to last hit
        Being able to know when to hit a minion such that it is killed by you, and not your minions
    Ability to create pressure
        When a good trade is taken, position more forwards in order to create that pressure
    Ability to recognize when they can take a positive trade
        A positive trade is one where you would take less damage than the opponent in a fight, or you kill your opponent, while remaining alive.
    Ability to tell when they should back to cash in
        If they have recently kill someone, recognizing whether they should fast push into tower, or back to quickly cash in and get to lane
            This is determined based on wave state, so you should be able to recognize that

Using Tensorflow Python API(wish it was C++ but its apparently unstable, so I'll hold off on that)
Reinforcement Learner
    train the model by using rewards for doing good actions:
        last hitting
        killing the enemy
        taking positive trades (you health loss < opponent health lost)
        etc.

Test and and keep training
    ensure that the model is getting positive feedback when it does something correctly
